## project overview
These lines are from the Black Eyed Peas- “Where is the Love” Verse 3 second half come to you as a question. I chose this one because it lists down some elements that I believe the grander part of humanity should have if you want to form a strong community. Those being equality, humanity, and unity, and it asked what ever happened to them. Of course, these values are still found, but it is lacking in many parts of the world, many even in smaller communities these may be lacking. It also has an opposing word within such as animosity which is one of the things you cannot have when building a strong community. Even if this song questions our outlook on these things, it is to help us encourage ourselves to answer these lyrics ourselves and improve on these things. Since this is a song that is 20+ years old, it is always something to come back and look at the lyrics and also comment on this song on YouTube. This song’s lyrics might as well be relevant for a long time since the world is not a perfect place but we always continue to build a better form of understanding between people.

## technical overview
In this project, extensive use of css was used for manipulation of words and effects as well as of course using html to form our lyrics that we wanted to manipulate. Techniques only involving animation and minor visual effects were used as no outside shapes, pictures, symbols, etc. were used. The lyrics would also be manipulated acccordingly in a thematic way.
